# Running SRMP as a server on Windows

The native alternative to [the Docker image](../server/README.md). Slime Rancher
is a Windows game, so running the server here skips the Wine translation layer
entirely — noticeably less overhead, and one large moving part fewer.

**Prefer this if you have a Windows box.** Use Docker only if your server is
Linux.

## What you need

- Windows, with a copy of Slime Rancher for the server to run
- **SRML installed** into that copy, and **`SRMP.dll` in `SRML\Mods`**
- The same `SRMP.dll` given to everyone who will join

The script refuses to start if SRML or the mod is missing, rather than launching
a game that quietly is not a server.

## Building a standalone server copy

`Get-SRMPServerFiles.ps1` produces a server folder that **runs without the Steam
client**. The host machine never holds a Steam session, so nobody is signed out
of Steam elsewhere because the server is running, and your friend can play on
another PC normally.

Two things to be clear about first:

- **SteamCMD still needs an account that owns the game** in order to download it.
  This removes the need to *run* Steam on the server, not the need to own the
  game. That login happens once, at download time.
- **If you already have the game installed, you do not need SteamCMD at all.**
  Copying that folder involves no Steam account on the server whatsoever, and is
  the simpler route.

### Copy from an install you already have (simplest)

```powershell
.\Get-SRMPServerFiles.ps1 -InstallPath C:\srmp-server `
  -FromExisting "E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Slime Rancher"
```

### Or download with SteamCMD

```powershell
.\Get-SRMPServerFiles.ps1 -InstallPath C:\srmp-server -SteamUser myaccount
```

SteamCMD is downloaded automatically. Steam Guard prompts on the first run only;
SteamCMD caches the result and the server keeps no Steam session afterwards.

Either way the script then installs SRML, installs `SRMP.dll` (taken from
`Builds\SRMP\SRMP.dll` unless you pass `-SrmpDll`), and prints the command to
start the server:

```powershell
.\Start-SRMPServer.ps1 -GamePath "C:\srmp-server"
```

Because this copy is separate from the one you play on, the auto-host config it
writes never affects your own game.

## Start it

Double-click **`Start SRMP Server.cmd`**, or from PowerShell:

```powershell
.\Start-SRMPServer.ps1
```

With options:

```powershell
.\Start-SRMPServer.ps1 -Username "MyServer" -Slots 8 -Operators "Alice","Bob"
```

The game is found automatically via the Steam registry and library folders. If
it is somewhere unusual, point at it:

```powershell
.\Start-SRMPServer.ps1 -GamePath "D:\Games\Slime Rancher"
```

When the world is up you get the friend code:

```
  ===================================
   FRIEND CODE: A7K2M9Q
  ===================================
```

It is also written to `<game>\SRMP\servercode.txt`, and it **changes on every
restart** — it is generated per lobby, not stored.

> **Use a separate copy of the game for the server.** Starting the server writes
> `Enabled: true` into `<game>\SRMP\autohost.json`, and that install will then
> auto-host whenever you launch it normally. Set `Enabled` back to `false` if you
> want to play on that copy again. `Get-SRMPServerFiles.ps1` builds exactly such
> a separate copy.

## Stop it

Press **Ctrl+C** in the server window, or run **`Stop SRMP Server.cmd`** from
elsewhere.

Either way the world is saved first. Unity does not flush a save when it is
killed, so stopping is a handshake: a request file is written, the mod saves,
closes the lobby and quits, and only then does the process end. **Do not close
the window with the X or use Task Manager** — that skips the save entirely and
costs everything since the last autosave.

## The GPU question

`-RenderMode` controls this, and `auto` is the default:

| Mode | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` | Uses the GPU if the machine has a real display adapter; otherwise `nographics`. |
| `nographics` | `-batchmode -nographics`. Unity never initialises graphics at all. |
| `gpu` | Forces real rendering at 640x480 through the GPU. |

**A GPU does not make the server faster, and `nographics` is usually the better
choice even on a machine that has one.** There is no video encoding anywhere in
this server — the GPU would only ever draw frames that nobody is looking at.
Skipping rendering frees that time for the game loop, which is the thing that
actually limits everyone's ping.

`auto` picks `gpu` when a card is present because that is the closest thing to a
normal launch and therefore the safest default if `nographics` ever misbehaves
with a particular build. If your server is running fine, try:

```powershell
.\Start-SRMPServer.ps1 -RenderMode nographics
```

and keep it if the friend code still appears.

Adapters reported as *Basic Display*, *Basic Render*, *Remote Display* or
*Standard VGA* are software renderers and are treated as no GPU — which is what
you get over RDP or on a headless VM.

**Never add `-force-glcore`.** This build ships D3D11 shaders only; forcing
OpenGL Core kills the game at engine init with
`InitializeEngineGraphics failed`.

## Options

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-GamePath` | auto-detected | Slime Rancher install to run. |
| `-Username` | `Server` | Name the host appears as. |
| `-GameName` | *(blank)* | World to host. Blank continues the most recent one. |
| `-GameMode` | `CLASSIC` | `CLASSIC`, `CASUAL`, `TIME_LIMIT`, `TIME_LIMIT_V2`. |
| `-Slots` | `16` | Lobby capacity including the host (2–64). |
| `-TickRate` | `60` | Server loop rate. Caps everyone's ping. `0` = uncapped. |
| `-RenderMode` | `auto` | See above. |
| `-Operators` | *(none)* | Names allowed to use `/tp`, `/ban`, `/unban`. |
| `-StatusIntervalSeconds` | `60` | Heartbeat line interval. `0` disables. |
| `-AutoSaveIntervalSeconds` | `300` | Forced save interval. `0` disables. |
| `-ShutdownGraceSeconds` | `45` | How long to let the world save before forcing. |
| `-WhatIfOnly` | off | Write the config and report, without launching. |

Operators are **required** for `/tp` and `/ban`: a headless server has nobody at
the keyboard, so leaving `-Operators` empty means nobody can use them.

## Running it unattended

To survive logout and start on boot, register a scheduled task:

```powershell
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'powershell.exe' `
  -Argument '-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\srmp\Start-SRMPServer.ps1" -Username "MyServer"'
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtStartup
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'SRMP Server' -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -RunLevel Highest
```

Note the game must run in a session that allows it to start. If you use
`nographics` this works in a background session; with `-RenderMode gpu` it needs
an interactive session to get a device.

## Chat commands

Identical to the Docker server — `/help`, `/tps`, `/ping`, `/list`, `/home`, and
`/tp`, `/ban`, `/unban`, `/banlist` for operators. Press **Tab** to complete
names. See the [Docker README](../server/README.md) for details, including how
bans are keyed and where the ban list is stored.

## Troubleshooting

**"SRML is not installed"** — run `SRMLInstaller.exe` in the game folder first.

**"SRMP.dll is not in SRML\Mods"** — build the mod and copy it there.

**No friend code appears** — EOS login failed. Check the console output and that
the machine has outbound internet.

**Players cannot join** — they must run the **exact same `SRMP.dll` build**. The
version bumps on every compile and mismatched versions are refused at connect.
